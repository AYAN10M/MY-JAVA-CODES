There are 3 types of errors in programming:

1) Syntax Errors/Compile Time Errors

    Errors that occur when we violate the rules of writing syntax are known as syntax errors.

    For example, 
        - missing semicolon at the end of statement
        - extra bracket in the code etc.
        
        These errors are detected by the compiler.

2) Logical Errors/Bugs

    Errors that occur when there is a mistake in the logic of the program are known as logical errors.
    
    For example, 
        - if we want to add two numbers but mistakenly we are subtracting them.
        - if we want to display the even numbers between 1 to 10 but mistakenly we are displaying odd numbers.
        
        These errors are detected by the programmer.

3) Runtime Errors/Exceptions
    
    Errors that occur during the execution of the program are known as runtime errors or exceptions.

    For example, 
        - division by zero
        - trying to open a file that doesn't exist
        - file not found etc.
            
        These errors are detected during the execution of the program.
